# PATHFINDING AND MAZE GENERATION VISUALIZER

Graphical User Interface built using React Framework to visualize Pathfinding Algorithms and Maze Generation Algorithms. Feel free to fork or download this project if you would like to try this out or use this code as the base to create your own Pathfinding Visualizer.

## Pathfinding Algorithms:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. Breadth First Search
3. Depth First Search


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Thank you

I hope you found the project useful and interesting.
